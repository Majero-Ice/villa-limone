# Villa Limone - Our Story

## The History

Villa Limone was built in 1920 as a private summer residence for the Marchetti family, wealthy merchants from Genoa who fell in love with this stretch of the Ligurian coast. The villa was named after the lemon grove that surrounded the property—a grove that still produces fruit to this day.

The original villa featured just six rooms, an expansive garden, and direct access to a private cove. The Marchetti family hosted artists, writers, and musicians throughout the 1920s and 1930s, making it a small cultural salon on the Italian Riviera.

## The Transformation

In 1985, the Rossi family—distant relatives of the original owners—acquired the property. Maria and Giuseppe Rossi had a vision: to transform the aging villa into a boutique hotel while preserving its historic character and intimate atmosphere.

The renovation took three years. Great care was taken to restore original features—the hand-painted ceiling in the dining room, the marble floors in the entrance hall, and the wrought-iron balconies overlooking the sea. Modern comforts were added thoughtfully, ensuring they complemented rather than competed with the villa's heritage.

Villa Limone opened as a hotel in 1988 with just four rooms. Today, we still maintain only four rooms and one suite, believing that true hospitality requires personal attention that larger properties cannot provide.

## The Lemon Grove

Our namesake lemon grove has been producing fruit for over a century. The Sorrento lemons grown here are prized for their intense fragrance and low acidity. We use them in our breakfast preserves, in cocktails at our bar, and in the limoncello we offer as a welcome gift to guests.

Each spring, when the lemon trees bloom, the entire property is filled with their sweet, citrus scent—a natural perfume that many guests remember long after their stay.

## The Rossi Family Today

Villa Limone is now managed by Marco and Elena Rossi, the third generation of the family. Marco oversees operations and can often be found chatting with guests at breakfast about the best hidden beaches or where to find authentic Ligurian cuisine. Elena manages the kitchen, creating menus that showcase local ingredients and her grandmother's recipes.

Their children, Luca and Sofia, represent the fourth generation and are already learning the family business, often helping during busy summer months.

## Our Philosophy

We believe that a hotel should be more than a place to sleep. It should be a home away from home, a base for exploration, and a source of genuine local knowledge.

Our staff-to-guest ratio is intentionally high. We don't have hundreds of rooms to fill—we have just four rooms and one suite. This allows us to know each guest by name, remember their preferences, and provide recommendations tailored to their interests.

We are not a luxury resort with anonymous service. We are a family home that we invite you to share.

## The Name "Limone"

While "limone" simply means "lemon" in Italian, the name carries deeper significance for us. The lemon tree is a symbol of the Mediterranean—of sunshine, abundance, and the good life. It represents our commitment to freshness, brightness, and the simple pleasures that make the Italian Riviera so special.

When you stay at Villa Limone, we hope you'll taste that sunshine in your breakfast jam, smell it in the garden air, and carry a bit of it home with you.
